#### Questions investigated in my analysis
> 1. Which Gender is most likely going to show up for their appointment and which is not.
> 2. Is age a determining factor to showing up for appointments as planned
> 3. Is the gap in time between scheduled day/time and appointment day/time a determining factor?
> 4. Are scholarship beneficiaries likely to default compared to Non beneficiaries
> 5. Are patients who receive reminders showing up than patients who do not?
